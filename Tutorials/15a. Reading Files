It's time to learn how to save information between game sessions!
You know how when the game is no longer running, there's currently no way to access your old high scores?
It's time we learned one way to save information like scores into an external file, and then access it back when the game starts running again.
This lesson will focus on .txt files, using Scanner.

If Scanner sounds familiar, it's because we talked about it during Loops.  Scanner was how the user was able to input data into the command prompt.
The way we initialized it was as follows:
Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
The parameter System.in tells Scanner to read what the user types into the System.
To read a text file already on your computer, you'll need a different parameter:
File f = new File("C:\\Users\\kylej\\Desktop\\Games\\Java\\Eclipse\\Test\\Test.txt");
Scanner s = new Scanner(f);

You can see that File takes a String parameter.
You can either hard-code the location, like we did in Loops, or you can ask the user to enter a String of the file's location.

The most common way to read a text file is creating an ArrayList of Strings, where each entry is one line of the text file.
ArrayList<String> arr = new ArrayList<String>();
String fileLocation = "wherever text file is";
Scanner s = new Scanner(new File(fileLocation));
while(s.hasNextLine()) {
  arr.add(s.nextLine());
}

You'll also notice that new File and new Scanner can be chained into the same line here.
But Scanner has a very cool trick up its sleeve - it can parse data.
Obviously, a text file only stores strings.  But if your text file contains numbers separated by spaces, tabs, or new lines, you can do this:
while (s.hasNextInt()) {
  int a = s.nextInt();
  System.out.println(a):
}
While reading your text file, it will generate ints.  This works for s.nextBoolean, s.nextFloat, and s.nextDouble.

What if your text file looks like this?

1 2 3
4
5

You have a couple options.
while (s.hasNextInt()) {
  System.out.println(s.nextInt());
}
will make:
1
2
3
4
5

HOWEVER
while (s.hasNextLine()) {
  System.out.println(s.nextLine());
}
will make:
1 2 3
4
5

Footnote to this tutorial - there are different tools available to read text files.
Scanner is nice because you can read different data types.
Another is called BufferedReader, which works faster but only reads Strings.
If you get to a point in your career where you want to use BufferedReader, it will be accepted in this course.
You can look at online examples or the bottom of the Loops 5 assignment.
