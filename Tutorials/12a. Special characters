There are some special characters for Strings.
	"\t" prints a tab
	"\b" prints a backspace
	"\n" prints a new line; "\r" is a carriage return, which do the same thing on most systems.  It's like Enter vs. Ctl+Enter
	"\"" prints a double quote
	"\\" prints a single backslash

Similarly, if you want a char to be a single apostrophe, char c = \'; will work.
