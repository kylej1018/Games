Useful commands:

In Assignment 1, you ran your first code using Command Prompt and a Notepad file saved on your desktop.
That should be the last time you use those tools, but in the event you want to use them, here are some tips.
They're in the form of examples, followed by what each one does.

cd Desktop/mycodingprojects/InProgress/MySecondCode
cd lets you change directory to Desktop/mycodingprojects/InProgress/MySecondCode
The computer will only look in the directory you're currently in for the path you put.
You have to navigate to the directory (folder) that has your code.  You might not save it on your Desktop.

cd ..
Change directory up a folder from where it's currently at

dir
Lists all contents of a directory

cls
Clear screen

javac MyFirstCode.java
Compiles a project.
Sometimes instead of compiling, you'll get errors and the location line of that error.  You can go to a location line in Notepad by clicking Ctl+G and typing "61" or any other number.

java myfirstcode
Runs a project that has been successfully compiled.
