Methods are useful when you have a specific function for the computer to do.
They're best when you want to do a similar thing lots of times, but they're also good for just organizing your code better.
You declare a method like so:
	public static boolean checkValue(int x, int y) { //returns true if x and y are the same.
		//code here
	}
public means it's accessible to other programmers borrowing your code.
All the methods we use, like e.getX() are public, which is why we can use them.
Obviously, our code won't be added to the official Java library...but there will come a day when we have our own library and need multiple codes in one program.
The opposite of public is private.  Very few methods are private.
Ultimately, since we're not creating objects yet, we don't have to really worry about accessing our methods from somewhere else.

You have the option to include static after public/private.
Don't worry about static yet, as we're not creating objects.

After public and static, you have the method return - boolean in this case.
You can return anything, an int, an array, or even nothing (void).  It's what comes out of the method.
This means that when you call that method, you can assign the result to a variable.
	boolean b = checkvalue(4, 3);
You might return a boolean, where something is true or false if it works.
If your method transforms an int into another int, you might have it return the new int.
If your method involves painting, you probably won't return anything (void).

After the return is the method name, checkValue in this example.
Remember that conventionally, method names start with a lowercase letter and anything with multiple "words" gets each word capitalized and spaces removed.
Make your method names as descriptive as you can.

Finally, you have the parameters (also called arguments).
	When your program calls the method, they're called arguments, but when you're defining them, they're called parameters.
They go in the parentheses.  You can have as many as you want, separated by commas, or a set of empty parentheses.
Each parameter needs a variable type (can be primitive or not) and a name that is used in the method definition.
You only want to pass along parameters needed to execute the method.
If you can cut down on the number of global variables by passing more parameters, it's usually recommended.
Empty parentheses are okay.
When you call a method and pass parameters, you communicate between two places in your code.  A global variable is recommended only if used in lots of methods.

Example:
	Making a method to paint something on repeat.
	public void myPaint(Graphics g) {
		Color favoriteColor;
		if(case1) {
			favoriteColor = Color.black;
		}
		if(case2) {
			favoriteColor = Color.blue;
		}
		int x = 0;
		drawCoolHouse(favoriteColor, g); //this is a call to a method written below
		drawCoolRoof(Color.red, g); //this is a call to another method written below
	}

	public void drawCoolRoof(Color c, Graphics g) {

	}

	public void drawCoolHouse(Color c, Graphics g) {
		g.setColor(c);
		g.fillRect(0, 0, 100, 100);
	}


In the body of the method, you will sometimes put a return statement.  It looks like this:
	return true;
That return type should match the return type in the method definition line.  You'll get an error if it doesn't.
When the return line is executed, the method stops immediately and the code returns to where the method was called.
In case of a void method, you could have
	return;
But it will stop the method immediately and return.
It's occasionally necessary to use multiple returns in a method in various circumstances.
	public boolean compare (int x, int y) {
		if(x == y) {
			return true;
		}
		return false;
	}
The method will only return false if return true never happens.  No ELSE statement needed!

Another method example:
	public int sumArray(int [] arr) { //intended to sum all the numbers in an array.  Takes an array as parameter and returns the sum as an int.
		int sum = 0;
		for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
			sum += arr[i];
		}
		return sum;
	}

Plan to comment every method with its intended purpose in a header.  You may also want to comment on the return type, parameters, and circumstances where the method is called.
By convention, you want to define methods in your code, in the order they're called.
Usually main() is first, then init(), then methods called from init(), then paint(), then methods called from paint(), then Listeners, then methods called from Listeners().
Anything that *can* stand alone should probably get its own method, especially if you can name it something obvious.
	public void drawSplashScreen(Graphics g) should start being in a vast majority of your codes, with the Graphics argument passed from paint or myPaint.
You want to keep your methods short, including main(), init(), paint(), and Listeners.

One other benefit of methods is a lot fewer global variables.  They can probably just be passed as arguments.

Note that methods are different from constructors.  Constructors have no return type, not even void.
