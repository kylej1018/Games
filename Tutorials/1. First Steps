Go to this site: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
Download the latest version of Java.  Make sure you're downloading something that says JDK, JRE is not enough.
Finish whatever installation is required by your system.
Take note of the path - something like C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_221\bin
  If you don't know how to do this, open your file explorer and click This PC, then Windows (C:).
  Click Program Files and look for a folder saying "Java."  If not, back up a step, it's in Program Files (x86).
  Click on the following folders: Java, then the one that says "jdk" with a bunch of numbers, then bin.
  Right-click the address bar at the top of your file explorer and copy that.  THAT is the path.

If you have an Apple, you'll have to look up how to edit environment variables. Windows users, keep reading.
Search Cortana for Edit the system environmental variables and click the first hit.
Make sure you're on the Advanced tab, then click Environment Variables...
Under the top box (User variables), click New...
Variable name: JAVA_HOME
Variable value: paste the path you saved earlier.
Press OK.

In the bottom box (System variables), click on "Path."
Under the bottom box, click Edit...
Click New.
Paste the path you saved earlier.
Press "Move Up" until your path is at the top.
Press OK a bunch of times to exit all these popups.

Now you can actually code.  Open Notepad and paste the sample code from MyFirstCode.java in the Assignments page.
Save that as MyFirstCode.java on your Desktop.
Search Cortana for Command Prompt and click the first hit.
Enter cd Desktop
Enter javac myfirstcode.java
If there were errors, stop and ask for help.
If there were no errors, enter java myfirstcode

It's traditional for your first assignment to be getting the computer to say "Hello, world!"  You've taken your first real step towards learning programming!
