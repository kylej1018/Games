You'll be once again working in a two-dimensional array.

In ConnectFour, we discussed the following formulas.
x = (# checkers to the left * checker width) + left margin
y = (# checkers above * checker height) + top margin

Is that all there is?  If you do that, your cards will take up ALL the space in your grid...and that will no longer make them look like cards.
You should plan to have a lil border around each one.
If you are drawing something three cards to the right, x isn't just the value of three card "widths."  It's three card "widths" plus three borders.

x = (# cards to the left * (card width + border)) + left margin

One more thought.  As you start to get creative with paint and making intricate designs on your cards, you may notice something.
If you want to draw a rectangle in your card, you may think you want 10% margins:
  g.drawRect(x + width/10, y + height/10, width * 8/10, height * 8/10);
Only problem is if your width and height aren't equal, you wind up with bigger gaps on top and bottom than on right and left.
If that bothers you, then check out this:
  g.drawRect(x + width/10, y + width/10, width * 8/10, height - (width * 2/10));
This offsets it by the same amount from the top as to the left.
