It's good to know how to use break or continue to make loops a little easier.
Break will end the loop you're currently in.  If you're inside mutliple loops, it will only break one loop - the innermost.
int x = 100;
  while (x > 1) {
  x = x / 2
    if (x == 25) { //this example ends the loop when x is 25.
      break;
    }
    System.out.println(x + "");
  }
Continue will skip one iteration of the loop you're currently in.
int x = 100;
  while (x > 1) {
  x = x / 2
    if (x == 25) { //this example skips over printing when x is 25.
      continue;
    }
    System.out.println(x + "");
  }
Break can be particularly useful when you're testing the value of an array in a while-loop.
After all, you don't want throw an error when your iteration variable gets too big for the array you're testing.
