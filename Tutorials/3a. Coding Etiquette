~ = etiquette or convention
blank = background

Comments:
#You should comment often so that people using (or helping with) your code can understand it easier.
#Use /* and */ for multi-line comments.  Use // for comments on one line.
~You should write variable names, method names, and method parameters so it's so obvious what they do, you shouldn't have to comment.
~But you should comment many of the following:
~  At the top of your code, what the program does and when it was last updated
~  Variable declarations
~  Methods.  In a header, include the purpose, the parameters, and the return.
~  Classes and interfaces, in a header.
~  Anytime you have to interact with the user - print statements, input/listener statements, System statements.
~  FIXMEs.  A FIXME is a line of code you know needs fixed.  If you can, specify what's wrong.
~  Loops.

Naming things:
#Anything with multiple "words" gets each word capitalized and spaces removed like so:
  thisIsAnExample
#Don't start a name with a number, but you can put a number in the middle of the name.
#Don't name things any of these keywords: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Java_keywords
~Variable and method names start with a lowercase letter.
  double salary = 18.50;
~Constants are all capitals with undercases and get the keyword "final"
  final int MAXIMUM_PEOPLE_ALLOWED = 100;
~Class and interfaces start with a capital letter.
  public class MyFirstCode

Indentation:
#Indent code inside curly brackets so it's easier to read.
~It doesn't really matter how much, but be consistent.  Recommended: 1 tab or three spaces.
~If you have curly brackets inside curly brackets, indent the interior part another tab or three spaces.

Spaces:
~Avoid extra blank lines.  There are some exceptions - if you're separating a bunch of related variables, it can help readability to have them separated by a blank line.


Conditionals:

Semicolons:
#Basically every line in java ends with a semicolon.  The only ones that don't open a curly bracket, or close an existing curly bracket.
