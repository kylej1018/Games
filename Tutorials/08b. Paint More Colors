Sometimes, you want a color that's different from the ones we used in PaintPalette.  They're kind of cheesy.
To do that, you need to make your own using the keyword "new" like so:
  Color myColor = new Color(80, 70, 60);
  g.setColor(myColor);
The three numbers in the parentheses are the red, green, and blue values.  They can each go from 0 to 255.

Not familiar with how red, green, and blue combine to make every single color?  That's okay!
Basically, (0, 0, 0) will be 100% black.
(255, 255, 255) will be 100% white.
(255, 0, 0) will be 100% red.
(0, 0, 255) will be 100% blue.
(0, 255, 0) will be 100% green.
Putting them at various values will make every other combination.
(127, 0, 0) will be a dark red.
(127, 127, 127) will be gray - 50% black and 50% white.
(255, 255, 0) will be 100% yellow.

Here's a cool trick:
  Color myColor = new Color(80, 70, 60, 100);
  g.setColor(myColor);
That fourth number is an alpha value.  It can also go from 0 to 255.
0 represents a 100% transparent color.
255 represents a 100% opaque color.
Anywhere inbetween and you'll be able to "see through" the shape you draw.
