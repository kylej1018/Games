There are a few different types of common variables to know.
int = an integer number.  Could be 1, 15, -3, or 0.
float = a decimal number.  Could be 1.01, -5.893.
double = basically the same as float, just takes more memory.
boolean = literally only can have the values true, false.  Sometimes you can have an expression that is essentially a boolean, like "a > 3" or "b < c".  These expressions are either true or false.
char = a character, surrounded by single quotes.  Could be 'a', 'g', 'A', '.', '#', or ' '.
String = a bunch of text, surrounded by double quotes.  Could be "mytext", "this is not a string", or " ".  The word String is capitalized.

For example, the value 8 is an int, the value 8.0 is a double, the value '8' is a char, and the value "8" is a String.

If they're declared in curly brackets, they're local variables and other parts of your code can't use them.
The opposite of local variables is global variables, which are established right after the class line.

Variables are established by a "Declare" where you specify the type of variable (int) and the name (x).
After the "Declare" statement is an "Initialization" statement where the variable is set equal to a value (10).
You can Declare and Initialize a variable on the same line:
  int x = 10;
or on different lines:
  int x;
  x = 10;

You can also "re-initialize" a variable at any time and give it a new value if you have no need for its old one.
Look at Tutorial 3a to review some conventions for naming your variables.
