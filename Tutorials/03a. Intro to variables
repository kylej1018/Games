There are a few different types of common variables to know.
int = an integer number.  Could be 1, 15, -3, or 0.
float = a decimal number.  Could be 1.01, or -5.893.
double = basically the same as float, just takes more memory.
boolean = only can have the values true or false.
  Sometimes you can have an expression that boils down to true or false, like "a > 3" or "b < c".  These expressions are technically booleans.
char = a character, surrounded by single quotes.  Could be 'a' 'g' 'A' '.' '#' or ' '.
String = a bunch of text, surrounded by double quotes.  Could be "mytext", "this is not a string", or " ".  The word String is capitalized.

For example, the value 8 is an int, the value 8.0 is a float, the value '8' is a char, and the value "8" is a String.
Similarly, true is a boolean and "true" is a String.

Variables are established by a "Declare" where you specify the type of variable (int) and the name (x).
After the "Declare" statement is an "Initialization" statement where the variable is set equal to a value (10).
You can Declare and Initialize a variable on the same line:
  int x = 10;
or on different lines:
  int x;
  x = 10;

You can also "re-initialize" a variable at any time and give it a new value if you have no need for its old one.

Variables can be declared after the line that says public class.  These are called "global variables" and can be used everywhere in your code.
Conversely, if variables are declared inside curly brackets, they're "local variables" and other parts of your code can't use them.
