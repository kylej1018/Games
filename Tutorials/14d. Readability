Methods is arguably where coding goes from a science to an art.
Previously, if you could imagine it, there was really one best way to code it and one best place to put that code.
Now, there are many different, similarly efficient, ways to structure your code.
But the art comes in the form of a question: How easy is it to debug?
And to that end, here are some tips.

1. Make sure you're still using Ctl + Shift + F. You don't want a bunch of weird space - horizontal OR vertical.
2. Be careful when naming variables.  Yes, it's true that they "disappear" after the curly brackets.
  Yes, you *could* name a keypressed char c and a paint color c and they'll never overlap.
  But the fewer times you name a variable the same, the better you'll be.
3. There's now an art to variables. Important variables get to be global, as do any that communicate between paint and keyPressed.
  If it doesn't seem 'important enough' to be global, but still needs to communicate between methods you write, it can be passed as a parameter.
  There should now be a lot more local variables. Some can be generated by methods, others can be made (within paint, for instance) and passed to any paint method that needs it.
4. Methods should be small enough that you can see the whole thing on one screen.
  Even if you have a bunch of very similar but not repeated functions, you might break them up.
    Example: In paint, I'm painting forty boxes.  I can't quite fit them all on one screen but they're too small to really deserve their own method.
    Solution: Make four methods - paintBoxes1, paintBoxes2, paintBoxes3, and paintBoxes4.  Each covers ten boxes.  Easy to read, easy to troubleshoot.
  NO MORE BIG BLOCKS OF TEXT!
5. But you also don't want thousands of methods, each only a line or two long.  That's also not very readable.
6. Reminder: Ctl + Shift + P will bounce between curly brackets.  Very handy when figuring out method sizes.
7. Name your methods something intuitive.
8. Comment above each method what it does. It will be fogotten after a month.
  Also get in the habit of commenting WHEN each method gets called.  Every paint refresh?  Under certain conditions?  Only once, right when the game is loaded?
