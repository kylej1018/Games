In Tutorial 05d, we introduced the idea of Try-Catch.  That one might be worth revisiting when writing files.

Question: How do you write a file gradually, updating it at several different moments in your code?
And, ideally, without putting your ENTIRE code in the try-catch block, which is bad form for the many places an exception might be caught.
Normally the syntax goes like this:
FileWriter file = new FileWriter(loc);
PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(file);
pw.println("output");
pw.close();

Problem: when assigning your FileWriter to be a new FileWriter, Eclipse says there's an unhandled exception.
Solution: Put it in the try-catch block.
try {
  FileWriter file = new FileWriter(loc);
}
catch (IOException ex) {
  ex.printStackTrace();
}
PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(file);
pw.println("output");
pw.close();

Problem: file is a local variable now, only in the try-catch block.  Eclipse says file can't be resolved to a variable.
You can't put PrintWriter in the try block, or you can't use pw.println("output") outside the try-catch block.
Solution: Declare and initialize FileWriter on two different lines.

FileWriter file;
try {
  file = new FileWriter(loc);
}
catch (IOException ex) {
  ex.printStackTrace();
}
PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(file);
pw.println("output");
pw.close();

Problem: Eclipse says file may not have been initialized.
Solution: initialize it with null.
FileWriter file = null;
try {
  file = new FileWriter(loc);
}
catch (IOException ex) {
  ex.printStackTrace();
}
PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(file);
pw.println("output");
pw.close();

Null is a handy keyword that simply means "empty."  The variable exists and it references something, but that something is an empty value.
You can assign anything to be null - Strings, ArrayLists.
Null is usually used in cases like this, where declaration and initialization are separated.
Putting the initializiation in a conditional or a loop makes Java think it may not happen (even if you know it will).
This also explains the phrasing behind NullPointerException - it just means something is empty.
