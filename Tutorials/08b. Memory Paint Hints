A 2D array is great for storing simple information like whether a card is visible, hidden, or removed from the game.
To paint that, it's a basic series of conditionals and not what this tutorial is about.
The challenge comes when it comes to translating a 2D chart to a visual paint.
Let's say you start your cards such that the upper-left is stored in array arr at [0][0].
Consider the "card" at arr[1][1].  It is one down and one right.
In your paint area, you'd draw that with the line - g.fillRect(x, y, width height);
But what are x and y?

Well, for the card in the upper left, at arr[0][0], x and y can be 0, 0.
The card at arr[1][1] wouldn't be at the x and y coordinates 1, 1...that'd be really quiet.
It would be one "width" over and one "height" down.
The card at arr[2][2] would be at two "widths" over and one "height" down.
The card at arr[1][2] would be at one "width" over and two "heights" down.
In other words, to get the x and y coordinates, you need to think of each card's location as arr[x][y], and multiply x by widths and y by heights.

Is that all there is?  If you do that, your cards will take up ALL the space in your grid...and that will no longer make them look like cards.
You should plan to have a lil border around each one.  Let that be a global variable.
