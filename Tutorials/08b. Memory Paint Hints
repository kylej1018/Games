One of the trickiest concepts you'll face for a while in programming is how to populate a 2D array.
Figuring out its size is usually easier said than done.
How many pieces of data do you have to store?  That's the area of a 2D array.
But when you initialize it with the New keyword, you only tell it how many rows and columns.  That has to be equal to your area when multiplied.
If you're looking at a piece of data, the row it's on, the column it's on, and the actual data may be three different numbers.
If you lose track, make a little sample in Excel or something to reference.

Automatically filling a 2D array is hard too.  Here are three different ways to construct loops for automatically populating int arrays.
Example 1: Make a 2D array of all prime numbers from 1-100.  Each row is a different tens digit, each column a different ones digit.
Solution 1: This one is smartest with a nested for-loop.  Your array would be 10x10.
  The outer loop keeps track of if you're in 10's, 20's 30's, etc. but also keeps track of the row you're on in your array.
  The inner loop loops from 0-9 every time the outer loop iterates.  If it's prime, it goes in the array.
Example 2: Make a 2D array of a video game character's max health and mana as he progresses through 25 levels.
Solution 2: This one makes some sense with two different loops.  Health and mana usually don't increase at the same rate, right?  Your array would be 3x25.
  The first loop tells you when health increases.  You'd figure out the formula, something like 3HP every five levels.
  The second loop tells you when mana increases.  It's probably a different formula, maybe 5MP every 8 levels.
  The third row wasn't specifically asked for, but it should be the level.
     You don't always know what will be useful later in the code.  What if one day you want to know what level you're at when you have 20HP and 15MP?
     Maybe you'll never use this.  But it's so little work now, and it would be so hard to add in later once you've forgotten your code.
  Could you combine these into one loop?  Maybe, if you were clever with the % operator.  But that sounds like a math bug waiting to happen.
Example 3: Make a 2D array where the first row counts from 1-100 and the second row counts from 100-1.
Solution 3: One loop is sufficient.  Your array can be 2x100.
   Let's say your iteration variable is i, as in for(int i = 0...).  Every time i increases, you fill the spot at [0][i] with i and the spot at [1][i] with 100-i.
   Just a reminder, rows and columns don't matter.  If your array is 100x2, you fill the spot at [i][0] with i and the spot at [1][i] with 100-i.
   
You don't always use the iteration variable for filling an array!

A 2D array is great for storing simple information like whether a card is visible, hidden, or removed from the game.
To paint that, it's a basic series of conditionals and not what this tutorial is about.
The challenge comes when it comes to translating a 2D chart to a visual paint.
Let's say you start your cards such that the upper-left is stored in array arr at [0][0].
Consider the "card" at arr[1][1].  It is one down and one right.
In your paint area, you'd draw that with the line - g.fillRect(x, y, width height);
But what are x and y?

Well, for the card in the upper left, at arr[0][0], x and y can be 0, 0.
The card at arr[1][1] wouldn't be at the x and y coordinates 1, 1...that'd be really quiet.
It would be one "width" over and one "height" down.
The card at arr[2][2] would be at two "widths" over and one "height" down.
The card at arr[1][2] would be at one "width" over and two "heights" down.
In other words, to get the x and y coordinates, you need to think of each card's location as arr[x][y], and multiply x by widths and y by heights.

Is that all there is?  If you do that, your cards will take up ALL the space in your grid...and that will no longer make them look like cards.
You should plan to have a lil border around each one.
