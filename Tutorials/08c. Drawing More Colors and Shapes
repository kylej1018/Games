COLORS
Sometimes, you want a color that's different from the ones we used in PaintPalette.  They're kind of cheesy.
To do that, you need to make your own like so:
  Color myColor = new Color(80, 70, 60);
  g.setColor(myColor);
The three numbers in the parentheses are the red, green, and blue values.  They can each go from 0 to 255.

Not familiar with how red, green, and blue combine to make every single color?  That's okay!
Basically, (0, 0, 0) will be 100% black.
(255, 255, 255) will be 100% white.
(255, 0, 0) will be 100% red.
(0, 0, 255) will be 100% blue.
(0, 255, 0) will be 100% green.
Putting them at various values will make every other combination.
(127, 0, 0) will be a dark red.
(127, 127, 127) will be gray - 50% black and 50% white.
(255, 255, 0) will be 100% yellow.

Here's a cool trick:
  Color myColor = new Color(80, 70, 60, 100);
  g.setColor(myColor);
That fourth number is an alpha value.  It can also go from 0 to 255.
0 represents a 100% transparent color.
255 represents a 100% opaque color.
Anywhere inbetween and you'll be able to "see through" the shape you draw.

SHAPES
g.drawOval and g.drawRect are great.
There's another one called g.drawPolygon.
Instead of taking an x, y, width, and height in the parentheses, g.drawPolygon only takes the following:
  An array of ints representing the x-coordinates of the vertices
  An array of ints representing the y-coordinates of the vertices
  The number of vertices

So if you want to draw, say, an isoceles triangle pointing right, you would have to do the following.
  int [] triangleX = new int[3];
  triangleX[0] = 10;
  triangleX[1] = 10;
  triangleX[2] = 40;
  int [] triangleY = new int[3];
  triangleY[0] = 50;
  triangleY[1] = 90;
  triangleY[2] = 70;
  g.drawPolygon(triangleX, triangleY, 3);
This will draw a point up high (10, 50), a point a little lower (10, 90), and a point over to the right (40, 70).

You could also do g.fillPolygon if you want your triangle filled in.
