This tutorial isn't more relevant for this assignment than any other.  But we need to talk about it sometime.
USERS ARE STUPID.  They will try to break your code.

Let's say your program asks the user for an array size and fills it with random numbers, then prints the first one.
Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
Random r = new Random();
int[] arr = new int[Integer.parseInt(s.nextLine())];
for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  arr = r.nextInt();
}
System.out.println(arr[0]);

That code looks great at first pass, right?
How many ways are there to mess it up?  What are the solutions?
1. User puts -1
>int[] arr = new int... doesn't work because you can't make an array of size -1
>if (array size > -1) then make array
>else tell the user to put a different number
2. User puts 0.
>arr can be initialized but the size is 0.
>arr[0] doesn't exist if the size is 0.  arr[0] is the first element.
>if (array size > 0) then print arr[0].
>else tell the user to put a different number
3. User puts 1.1
>Integer.parseInt doesn't work
>Change it to Float.parseFloat
3.1 As a result, array declaration from Step 2 doesn't work again
>another if statement
>else tell the user to put a different number
3.2 That if statement might wind up comparing a float to an int.  Better typecast that.
4. User puts a letter
>Float.parseFloat doesn't work
...and so on and so on.

Sometimes it's not the users.  Sometimes it's another part of your code that passes along an unhelpful variable.

TL;DR
arr[0] is great until your array size is 0.
Try to think of every possible value your variables might be assigned.
