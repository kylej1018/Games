Sometimes you need lots of variables remembered.  We store them in a list called an "array."
You can store ANY variable type in an array.
Making an array of ints named "arr" is not too hard.
  int [] arr = new int[10];
The [10] means that this list has 10 elements.  You need to know how big your array is right when you make it.
You can figure out how long an unknown array is with int x = arr.length;
You can access an element in an array with int x = arr[5], which returns the element at Index 5.
You can assign an element in an array with arr[5] = 100, which assigns the value 100 to Index 5.

Here's the rub.  Place 5 is not the fifth place.
ARRAYS START AT 0.  The first element is arr[0].  The second element is arr[1], and so on.
There is nothing at arr[arr.length].  If you have an array with length 3, its indexes are 0, 1, and 2.  There is no 3.
The last element is at arr[arr.length - 1].
