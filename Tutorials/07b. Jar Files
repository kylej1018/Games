Sometimes you want to be able to run a program just by double-clicking a file.  That's when we use jar files.

1. Complete program code for MyProgram.java.  Program must activate through public static void main(String []args)
2. Compile to generate MyProgram.class
3. In folder with MyProgram, make a document named manifest.txt containing the following, with the two blank lines after:
Main-Class: MyProgram


4. In command prompt, use cd navigate to folder with MyProgram.  You're about to create a jar file.
5. Type the following into command prompt:
jar cfm MyProgram.jar manifest.txt *
You can replace the star with MyProgram.class as long as there's only one.
6. Your new jar file should open on double-click, along with command prompt. Steps 7-8 get rid of command prompt, so only do them if you're not using it.
7. Make a text document named MyProgram.bat containing the following:
start javaw -jar -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m MyProgram.jar
8. Bat file should open on double-click without command prompt.
9. Recommended: Make a shortcut to your jar (or bat if you have one) file somewhere more convenient.
10. If you're giving other people these files, they really only need the jar and bat file, but their computer also needs a java download, preferably the same version as what you have.

Any changes to your program require recompiling (duh) and making new jar file (step 4-5), but the bat file needs no adjustment.

If jar file doesn't open on step 6...
a. Search Windows Start Menu for "regedit"
b. HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Explorer/FileExts
c. If .jar folder exists, right-click and delete it
d. HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/jar_auto_file/shell/open/command
e. Double-click (Default)
f. Type the following, with appropriate location:
"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_221\bin\java.exe" "-jar" "%1" %*
g. Press OK to exit all these windows.  Jar file should open.
