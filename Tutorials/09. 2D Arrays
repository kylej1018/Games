You can have two-dimensional arrays.  They look like this:
  int [][] arr = new int [3][5];
That command makes a 3x5 grid.
You access the first element at arr[0][0] and the last one at arr[2][4].
You could even have three, four, or higher dimensional arrays.
  int [][][][] arr = new int[4][4][4][4];
That command makes a hypercube.
