You can have two-dimensional arrays.  They look like this:
  char[][] arr = new char[3][5];
That command makes a 3x5 grid of chars, but you could easily make one for ints or booleans.
You access the first element at arr[0][0] and the last one at arr[2][4].
Technically, your computer reads a 2D array as an array (size 3) of arrays (each size 5).

You could even have three, four, or higher dimensional arrays.
  int[][][][] arr = new int[4][4][4][4];

Here's an example of how you might populate a 2D array and access one element.
int[][] arr = new int[5][3];
int x = 10;
for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  for(int j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
    arr[i][j] = x;
    x = x + 2;
  }
}
System.out.print(arr[4][0]);
