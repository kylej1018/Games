You can have two-dimensional arrays.  They look like this:
  char[][] arr = new char[3][5];
That command makes a 3x5 grid of chars, but you could easily make one for ints or booleans.
You access the first element at arr[0][0] and the last one at arr[2][4].
Technically, your computer reads a 2D array as an array (size 3) of arrays (each size 5).

You could even have three, four, or higher dimensional arrays.
  int[][][][] arr = new int[4][4][4][4];
