Sometimes you only want things to happen "if" a statement is true.
You use a conditional statement likd this:
  boolean b = true;
  if(b) {
    //code
  }
Inside the parentheses is a boolean variable (above) or a boolean expression (below).
  if(x > 10) {
    //code
  }
If the boolean variable or expression inside the parentheses is true, the code will execute.
If not, that code will be skipped.
Here are some useful operators
  > greater than
  < less than
  == equal to
    You need 2 equals signs, otherwise, it thinks you're ASSIGNING a variable to a value rather than comparing.
  >= greater than or equal to
  <= less than or equal to
  != not equal to
  !< not less than
  !> not greater than

You can even use the ! symbol like this:
  boolean b = true;
  if(!b) {
    //code
  }

You may also want to test if two things are true - check these examples!
if(a == 3 && b < 1) "If a is 3 and b is less than 1"
if(a == 3 || b < 1) "If a is 3 or b is less than 1"
if(a != 3 && !(b < 1)) "If a is not 3 and not-(b is less than 1)"
  The bottom one is equivalent to saying "If a is not 3 and b is greater than or equal to 1"

By convention, it's frowned upon to use ==true or ==false in your code.
Instead of if(b == true)
Use if(b)
