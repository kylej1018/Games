Sometimes you only want things to happen "if" a statement is true.
You use a conditional statement likd this:
  boolean b = true;
  if(b) {
    //code
  }
Inside the parentheses is a boolean variable (above) or a boolean expression (below).
  if(x > 10) {
    //code
  }
If the boolean variable or expression inside the parentheses is true, the code will execute.
If not, that code will be skipped.
Here are some useful operators
  > greater than
  < less than
  == equal to
    You need 2 equals signs, otherwise, it thinks you're ASSIGNING a variable to a value rather than comparing.
  >= greater than or equal to
  <= less than or equal to
  != not equal to
  !< not less than
  !> not greater than

You can even use the ! symbol like this:
  boolean b = true;
  if(!b) {
    //code
  }

You may also want to test if two things are true - check these examples!
if(a == 3 && b < 1) "If a is 3 and b is less than 1"
if(a == 3 || b < 1) "If a is 3 or b is less than 1"
if(a != 3 && !(b < 1)) "If a is not 3 and not-(b is less than 1)"
  The bottom one is equivalent to saying "If a is not 3 and b is greater than or equal to 1"

Sometimes you need "else" statements.  They look like this.
boolean condition1 = false;
boolean condition2 = false;
boolean condition3 = false;
if(condition1) {
  //code
}
else if(condition2) {
  //code
}
else if(condition 3) {
  //code
}
else {
  //code
}
In this example, only the code in the brackets around the last "else" got executed.
You can have as many "else if" conditionals as you want.  This example had 2.
You can have a final "else" statement to capture EVERYTHING not yet covered...or just leave it out.

By convention, it's frowned upon to use ==true or ==false in your code.
Instead of if(b == true)
Use if(b)
