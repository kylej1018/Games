This tutorial isn't more relevant for this assignment than any other.  But we need to talk about it sometime.
Okay, so you've designed the perfect loop to do something.  It takes an input and builds a String, or it creates an array, or it paints every rectangle on your screen.

But sometimes not every input goes perfectly into your loop.  Are there letters leftover after your String?
You'll get an error.  Index out of bounds is the most common one.  And every time, it means you didn't think of that one case.
You don't have any user input for this assignment.  But when you do, always assume they're going to push the wrong key.

Let's say your program wants to divide 600 by a number the user inputs.
600 / r.nextInt(); sounds really good, right?
What if the user puts 0.5?
What if the user puts -1?
What if the user puts 0?
What if the user puts $?
These are the kinds of questions you also want to be asking your loops if you change your iteration variable inside the loop.

Once you fix the One Exception, there sometimes is One More Exception.  And One More after that.
Being able to figure out what they are quickly is a huge help when debugging.
