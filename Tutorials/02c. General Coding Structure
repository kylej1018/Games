Open the code for Picture and follow along with this tutorial.  Try to find all these items in the Picture code!
Here's the basic outline of every code:

Import Statements:
#Codes usually start with import statements.  When you downloaded Java, you downloaded a lot of helpful things, but your code won't use them unless they're imported.
#If your code returns an error when compiling that it doesn't recognize something or it thinks you should define it, double-check what imports you need.
You can look it up on the Internet.  Searching "java color import statement" will highlight many other people who have similar problems.
Example time!
 import java.awt.*;
 import java.awt.event.*;
 import java.lang.Object;
 These are three distinct import statements.  The * means "everything in that package."  So the entire contents of the java.awt package are imported in the first line.
 java.awt.event is not in the java.awt package.  Common misconception.  It's a whole separate package.
 java.lang.Object IS in the java.lang folder.  I know this because Object is capitalized, meaning it's a class, but everything before it is not, meaning it's a package.
 Thus, if I had written java.lang.* then I don't need to write java.lang.Object
 These packages and the classes inside them all live in your computer system, in the same file where you downloaded Java.
~If only one class is used from a package, import that class by name.  If two or more, use the * symbol.

Class:
#Below import statements is something like public class Picture.
#Whatever the word is after "class" should be the same name as the name of your .java file.

Global Variables:
#After the class statement is often a collection of variables, like int x = 10;
#You can declare a variable anywhere (it's called a local variable) but you can only use it within those curly brackets.
 The reason there are usually lots at the beginning (global variables) is because ALL curly brackets can use them.
#There are some things you CAN'T name your variables because they're reserved keywords for specific java functions.
 For instance, don't name your variable "class" because "class" is used at the top of your code, like public class Picture.
 A complete list of keywords not to use is here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Java_keywords

Main:
#After the variables is something called public static void main(String[] args) and it's usually essential for the code.

Init:
#After main, you'll see something called public void init() and it's usually nonessential.
Init is short for initialization because it often initializes most of your global variables.  It also usually "starts" the game (or whatever) you've programmed.
Init can happen whenever you reset the game.
You should be able to write
 init();
anywhere in your program and it jumps to the code in public void init().

PreInit:
#After main, you'll see something called public void preInit() and it's usually nonessential.
This is something that I have provided to you for your codes that require painting, clicking the mouse, or popup windows.
I call it preInit() because it runs early on in the code, before init(), which initializes most things.
PreInit should only happen once.  You don't want two popup windows.  You should not ever have to write
 preInit();

Public Void:
#After main is a series of curly-bracket-enclosed areas labeled public void, such as public void myPaint.
 These are called methods.  You'll learn how to make your own methods later.

#Finally, notice that almost every line ends in a semicolon.  Each line is one task for the computer to do.
#The only exceptions are the lines that have an open curly bracket.  These allow tasks to be grouped together.
