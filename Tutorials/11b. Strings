You could argue that Strings are, in a way, arrays of chars.  Which might explain why they're not primitive, and why they're capitalized.
Let's say we have String s = "apple";
You can figure out how long an unknown array is with int x = s.length;
You can find the char at an index with s.charAt(0), which would be 'a' in this case (yes, Strings start at 0 too).
You can find the first index of a smaller String with s.indexOf("p"), which would be 1 in this case.
You can find the last index of a smaller String with s.lastIndexOf("le"), which would be 3 in this case.
You can test alphabetical order of Strings with s1.compareTo(s2).
  If the answer is > 0, s1 is first alphabetically.  If the answer is < 0, s2 is.  If the answer is 0, they have the same letters.
You can make a string all the same case with s.toUpperCase() or s.toLowerCase();
You can split off part of a string at a certain index.
  String s2 = s.substring(2);
    ^will be "ple", or from index 2 inclusive to the end of s - chars at 2, 3, 4...
  String s3 = s.substring(0, 2);
    ^will be "ap", or from index 0 inclusive to index 2 exclusive - chars at 0, 1.
   
It'd be nice to ask if two Strings are the same.
  String s1 = "apple";
  String s2 = "apple";
But if you test s1 == s2, the answer is false.  Here's why.
Remember how we said there are primitive variables?  If you compare them with ==, it's going to ask if they have the same VALUE.
Strings are not primitive.  If you compare them with ==, it's going to ask if they are the same OBJECT.  Which they aren't.
s1 and s2 are stored in totally different places in your computer.  They're different objects.
The way around this is to test if s1.equals(s2), which will return true if they have the same text and false if not.

Finally, arrays and ArrayLists have convenient ways to change a single element.  Strings don't.
If you want to change a single letter in Strings, the best way to do that is to use substring.
  String s = "There is a typo in this sintence.";
  s = s.substring(0, 24) + "e" + s.substring(26);
  
  String s = "There is a typoo in this sentence.";
  s = s.substring(0, 15) + s.substring(16);
