There is no truly random number.  A computer can generate a pseudo-random number using a random number library, which looks like this:

It *looks* random and will be useful in a majority of coding you do.

To use it, you have to make a random number generator ONCE per code.
  Random r = new Random();
and then actually generate a number as many times as you like.
  int x = r.nextInt();
  double x = r.nextDouble();
  float x = r.nextFloat();
  boolean x = r.nextBoolean(); //not a number, obviously

You can set boundaries of r.nextInt():
  int x = r.nextInt(100); //will give you a random number between 0 and 99 inclusive.
What if you really wanted it from 1 to 100?
  int x = r.nextInt(100) + 1;
But not
  int x = r.nextInt(100 + 1); //this will give you a random number between 0 and 100 inclusive.

r.nextDouble() and r.nextFloat() have a lower bound of 0.0 and an upper bound of 1.0 inclusive.
What if you really wanted it from 0.0 to 100.0?
  float x = r.nextFloat() * 100;
What if you wanted it from 1.0 to 100?
  float x = r.nextFloat() * 99 + 1;
