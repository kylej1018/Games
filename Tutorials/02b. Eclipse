You figured out how to get Java working on your computer!
Honestly, Notepad + command prompt is a pretty lousy practice.  It's easy to make lots of mistakes.
Many Java programmers use a software called Eclipse: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

Eclipse is what's called an IDE - really just an environment for you to code in.
It's far easier to read your code and catch your mistakes.

Eclipse Layout:
Every time you start a new assignment, you'll want to make a new Java project.
Go to File > New > Java Project.
At the top, you give it a name and determine where all the files will save.
Under JRE, it should say
  Use default JRE 'jdk1.8.0_221' and workspace compiler preferences
The actual jdk number should match the Java you downloaded, in This PC > C: > Program Files > Java
If not, stop and ask for help.
When you're getting started, it's nice to have all your files in one place, so select
  Use project folder as root for sources and class files
What you code is a source file, a ".java" file.
Once you compile it, your computer makes a ".class" file written in Computer Language that you can't edit but it knows how to run.
If you had selected the other option, all the ".class" files would get their own folder (bin) separate from the folder with your ".java" files (src, short for source).

Once you've made your Java Project, select File > New > Class.
Make sure it's in the correct folder.
Give it a name.  Eclipse will tell you if the name is invalid.
Always select the option to create the method stub
  public static void main(String [] args)
But not the other two.

Eventually, there will be classes that have to be run together in the same project.

Now, you have a big coding area in the middle and a few windows around.  You can move these windows to where you want.
You can also add more windows in Window > Show View
Here's how I customize my workspace:
In the upper left corner, I have my Package Explorer.  It lets me see all the projects I've recently opened.
In the lower left corner, I have my Outline.
In the upper right, I have my Console.  You probably have to go to Window > Show View to find it but it's critically important.
In the lower right, I have Problems.
Everything else, I close so I'm not distracted.

You should try HelloWorld again in Eclipse.
When it's all copy-pasted, it's time to run it.
Whenever you run a new program for the first time, you have to right click main(String []) : void in the Outline window and select Run As > Java Application.
Afterwards, you can press the green button icon with the white arrow that says "Run."
If you can't get HelloWorld to run, stop and ask for help.
