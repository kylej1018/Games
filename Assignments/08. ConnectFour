Connect4
Make a 2-player Connect 4 game.

Rules:
The board is 7-across by 6-up.
A turn consists of adding a checker to any column; it drops to the bottommost available spot.
It is then the other player's turn.
The game is over when the computer detects 4-in-a-row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
The computer should highlight the winning lineup and offer to play again.

Suggestions:
Your board should consist of a 2-D array.  Each element may be empty or have a checker from Player 1 or Player 2.
A valid move should occur if the mouse is within a column width.
If that column is full, no move is allowed.
MouseClicked is essential. MouseMoved could give the impression that you're dragging the next checker along.
