/* INSTRUCTIONS
 * Make an app called GuessingGame.
 * 
 * You've should now have the ability to copy-paste the relevant statements from previous codes and modify them.  Thus, you get no code skeleton here.
 * 
 * GuessingGame should not use KeyListener or MouseListener.  Use Scanner.
 * Use System.out.print, not myPaint.
 * Make an appropriate class line and public static void main line.
 * Since your program should use System.out.print and Scanner, it should be entirely coded within main.
 * When the game starts, the computer should have a random number between 1 and 100.
 * It should tell the user to guess and indicate the numberical limits.
 * Computer takes numerical input.
 * Based on what the user guesses, the computer should provide a hint to guess bigger or smaller.
 * Computer takes input again & continues to respond with hints until the user guesses correctly.
 * When the number is guessed, the computer should indicate success, tell the user how many tries they took, and comment on how well they did, ideally in a humorous way.
 * The computer offers to play again and prompts the user to respond (Y, N, y, n, Yes, No, YES, NO, yes, no).
 * For every user line, have a while loop that only breaks if the user types what you're expecting.
